//    Let's build a matchmaking system that helps discover jobs for developers based on a number of factors.

//One of the simplest, yet most important factors is compensation.As developers we know how much money we need to support our lifestyle, 

//so we generally have a rough idea of the minimum salary we would be satisfied with.

//Let's give this a try. We'll create a function match which takes a candidate and a job, which will either return a boolean indicating 

//whether the job is a valid match for the candidate.


//A candidate will have a minimum salary, so it will look like this:


//Candidate candidate =
// new Candidate(MinSalary: 120000);
//A job will have a maximum salary, so it will look like this:

//Job job =
//  new Job(MaxSalary: 140000);
//If either the candidate's minimum salary or the job's maximum salary is not present, throw an error.

//For a valid match, the candidate's minimum salary must be less than or equal to the job's maximum salary.

//However, let's also include 10% wiggle room (deducted from the candidate's minimum salary) 

//in case the candidate is a rockstar who enjoys programming on Codewars in their spare time. 
    
//The company offering the job may be able to work something out.
